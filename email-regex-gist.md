# Regex Tutorial: Email Validation

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will break down the components of a regular expression designed to validate email addresses. Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching, and understanding how to build them can greatly enhance your coding projects.

## Summary

This tutorial explains the regex used for email validation: `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`. We will explore how each part of this expression works to ensure that a string matches a valid email format.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

**`^` and `$`**
The caret `^` matches the start of a string, while the dollar sign `$` matches the end. This ensures that the regex does not allow characters outside the specific pattern of an email address.

### Quantifiers

**`+` and `{2,6}`**
The `+` quantifier matches one or more of the preceding element, making sure that each part of the email has at least one character. The `{2,6}` quantifier specifies that the top-level domain must be between 2 to 6 letters long.
